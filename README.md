# Description

This script allows to convert markdown to DOCX, primarily targeting GOST 7.32 (ГОСТ, государственный стандарт, national standard).
I've felt much pain in my back parts, because every WYSIWYG editor, except MS Word, is laggy and error prone.

The main reason to use this tool is fast creation of DOCX files and making edits to it. Thanks to programmatic approach,
you can easily extend the script and inject your own code.
